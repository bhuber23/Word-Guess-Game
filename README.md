# Word-Guess-Game
This project is my take on the classic game of Hangman, with a Who's That Pokemon theme. The objective is to press keys on the keyboard to guess which Pokemon has been generated for you. 

## Link to the Game: 
https://bhuber23.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Features:
- When starting the game, you will receive the blank letters of the Pokemon generated along with the empty image of the Pokemon as a hint, inspired by the original tv show.
- When you guess the Pokemon correctly, you will see the full image and hear a sound clip of the Pokemon.
- You may have up to 6 missed letters before losing. When the game is lost, a new Pokemon will automatically be generated. When the game is won, press the button to play again.
- The game will track both wins and losses.
